The Project: Simple Bank
Step 1. Design the database schema and generate SQL code
    https://dbdiagram.io/home is a free source for building databases.
    In this websit, use DBML(database markup language) to design the database, then it could be convert to Any DataBase Language(in this project, use postgres)
    To write DBML, refer https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home/#intro

Step 2. Install and use Docker + Postgres + TablePlus to create DB schema
    download Docker desktop(https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which will also build docker in enviroment. The docker is a useful tool to implement micro-service, refer https://philipzheng.gitbook.io/docker_practice/ to discover further.

    next, download the postgres's image on docker hub:
        docker pull [image]:[tag]
    then start a container:
        docker run --name [container_name] -e [enviroment_variable] -p [host_ports:container_ports] -d [image]:[tag]
    In our case, run:
        docker run -it --name [container_name] -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -d postgres:12-alpine
        // the user and password will be used later in TablePlus to create a connect.
    after start a container, we can run command in it:
        docker exec -it [container_name/container_id] [command] [args]
    In our case, run:
        docker exec -it [container_name] psql -U root
        ref: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
        we can into interactive interface since we use -i, then we can input some psql command in terminal. (use \q can exit the interface)
    
    Tableplus is a GUI for sql database, we can use it to connect to databases and input sql command to edit databases.

    Some common quick button:
    -   ctrl + r: refresh
    -   ctrl + s: save

Step 3. Write and Run database migration
